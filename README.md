# game_toxicity_detect

Design and test different models to solve a classic natural language processing task – name entity recognition. The goal is to train the model such that it can correctly identify whether a Dota player’s chat message is one of the slot types: T(toxicity), C(Character), D(Dota-specific), S(Game Slang), P(Pronoun), O(Other).
